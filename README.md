# Optimizing Supply Chain Operations of SMEs in Ghana Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to improve **demand forecasting**
and **inventory management** for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Ghana.

The study is based on **primary data collected through structured questionnaires**
administered to SME owners and managers, capturing inventory practices, demand patterns,
and operational challenges.

The goal is to demonstrate how data-driven decision-making can help SMEs reduce
stockouts, minimize overstocking, and improve supply chain efficiency.
